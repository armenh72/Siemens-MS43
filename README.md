Rom Raider logger and ECU definitions for ms43

These definitions have been created for RomRaider based on the excellent work by the ms4x dev team (ms4x.net) who created definitions for TunerPro. I have started porting these across to RomRaider.

I will only be updating definitions for v430069 which is the latest version, and only for partial reads.
Should anyone else like to contribute

a) other versions, or

b) full flash locations

Please feel free to submit your additions for merging into the master branch

The logger definition has been created based on my work in uncovering the custom telegram method which allows faster polling rates and selecting multiple parameters not previously available under standard logging protocols.
